# Enterprise Code Signing Certificate Rollout Plan

## 1. Request and Tracking
- Developer opens a ticket requesting code signing capability  
- Ticket used to track approvals, reviews, and issuance  

## 2. Training
- Mandatory training for developers on:
  - Using certificates in Visual Studio and SignTool  
  - Secure storage of keys  
  - Consequences of misuse (revocation, audit)  

## 3. Cybersecurity Review
- Cyber team validates request against business need  
- Confirms compliance with enterprise PKI policy  
- Documents certificate ownership and intended use  

## 4. Network Review
- Ensure signed applications are allowed through enterprise security stack  
- Confirm antivirus, EDR, and network security tools trust enterprise CA chain  
- Validate certificate distribution and revocation mechanisms (CRL/OCSP)  

## 5. Certificate Issuance
- PKI team issues code signing certificate from enterprise CA  
- Certificate stored in secure key store (HSM or userâ€™s cert store with protections)  
- Usage tied to developer identity for accountability  

## 6. Developer Integration
- Developer retrieves issued certificate per approved ticket  
- Configures Visual Studio to use the certificate  
- Uses Microsoft SignTool for CLI signing of binaries  

## 7. Verification and Testing
- Signed application submitted to internal test environment  
- Confirm AV/EDR no longer flags internally signed apps  
- Validate digital signature integrity and chain of trust  
- Ensure signature timestamping is enabled for long-term validity  

## 8. Operational Controls
- Periodic audit of certificate usage  
- Expiry and renewal management (alerting 30 days prior)  
- Incident response process if cert is misused or compromised
