## MVP

> An MVP, or Minimum Viable Product, is a version of a product with enough features to be usable by early customers and provide them with value, allowing for feedback and iteration. It's designed to be the simplest possible version of the product, focusing on core functionality and avoiding unnecessary complexity. The goal is to quickly validate a product idea and gather user feedback before investing heavily in full-fledged development. 

### Characteristics

#### Minimal Features
- It includes only the essential features needed to address the core user problem or need.

#### Early User Adoption
- Designed to appeal to early adopters who are willing to provide feedback.

#### Feedback-Driven Iteration
- Success requires gathering feedback from users. Feedback drives improvements in subsequent product iterations and minimizes the risk of wasting time and resources on features that users don't value.

#### Risk and Cost
- The businesses can mitigate the risk of delivering a product nobody wants by putting the product into the hands of users early and often.

#### Focus on Core Value
- The MVP should clearly demonstrate the core value proposition of the product to early adopters. The businesses can test their assumptions and validate their product idea before committing to an unknown.

#### Accelerate Time to Market
- Speed is crucial, both in terms of features delivered and overall adoption. It is better to be 60% correct today than 100% correct tomorrow.
