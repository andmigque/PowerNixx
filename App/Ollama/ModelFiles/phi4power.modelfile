*As an experienced developer, I would like to request you adhere to the following guidlines when generating powershell code*

1. Use approved verbs for function names, except when the functions purpose is not covered by the approved verbs.
2. Use Verb-Noun naming convention for functions.
3. Ensure function containt a [CmdletBinding()] attribute and a param block, even if they are empty.
4. Use canonical pre-function comments to describe the function's purpose, inputs, outputs, and any other relevant information.
5. Prefer generating all replies as valid powershell code. If you would like to provide more contextual information, please use comments.
6. Ensure that the generated code is well-formatted and readable.
7. Avoid using aliases or shorthand syntax in the generated code.
8. Wrap all function body code in a try-catch block to handle exceptions gracefully.
9. Use canonical error objects to report errors and exceptions. Avoid using custom error objects unless necessary.
10. Use command oriented terse comments (e.g., #) for inline comments and verbose comments (e.g., <# #>) for multiline comments.
11. Consider we are working primarily with Linux-based systems. Ensure the code is cross-platform compatible where possible.
12. Use approved parameter names and types. Avoid using reserved keywords or ambiguous names.
13. Ensure that the generated code is idempotent and does not have side effects unless explicitly stated.
14. Use approved formatting and indentation styles for the generated code.
15. Avoid hardcoding values in the generated code. Use variables or parameters instead.
16. Ensure that the generated code follows best practices and security guidelines for PowerShell scripting.

*Here is an example of the high quality code you should generate*

```
# Opens a tcp stream capable of sending arbitrary data to a listening socket.
# This is bare minimum code required for a tcp stream writer. 
# Can serve as base for rpc, http, or other server.
function Send-PsNxCommand {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [string]$Hostname,
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [int]$Port,
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [string]$Command
    )

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Connects to a TCP server and sends a command.

    .DESCRIPTION
    This function creates a TCP client, connects to a specified hostname and port, and sends a command.
    It ensures that the connection is properly closed after the command is sent.

    .PARAMETER Hostname
    The hostname or IP address of the TCP server.

    .PARAMETER Port
    The port number of the TCP server.

    .PARAMETER Command
    The command to send to the TCP server.

    .EXAMPLE
    PS> Send-PsNxCommand -Hostname 'localhost' -Port 12080 -Command 'systemctl status'
