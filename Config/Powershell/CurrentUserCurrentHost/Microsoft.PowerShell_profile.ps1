	# 3. `e[0m` is an escape code that resets the text color back to the default.
	# 4. ` ü¶æ( Õ°‚öà  ñ Õ°‚öà)` is a fun little ASCII art of a serious programmer flexing his muscles.
	# 5. `e[4m`e[35m` is a sequence of escape codes that set the text color to bright magenta.
	# 6. `$gitBranch` is the string that contains the name of the current git branch.
	# 7. `e[0m` is an escape code that resets the text color back to the default.
	# 8. `e[4m` is an escape code that sets the text color to bright blue.
	# 9. `$($executionContext.SessionState.Path.CurrentLocation)` is a string that contains the current directory.
	# 10. `e[36m` is an escape code that sets the text color to bright cyan.
	# 11. `  üïí $shortTime` is the current time, formatted as hours and minutes.
	# 12. `e[0m` is an escape code that resets the text color back to the default.
	# 13. `e[94m` is an escape code that sets the text color to bright blue.
	# 14. `‚ï∞‚îà‚û§` is a box-drawing character that looks like the bottom-left corner of a box.
	# 15. `e[0m` is an escape code that resets the text color back to the default.
	# 16. `$(' ' * ($nestedPromptLevel + 1))` is a string that contains a number of spaces.
	# The number of spaces is equal to the value of the $nestedPromptLevel variable,
	# plus one. This is used to indent the prompt text.
