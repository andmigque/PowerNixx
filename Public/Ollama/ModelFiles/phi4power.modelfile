*As an experienced developer, I would like to request you adhere to the following guidelines when generating Powershell code*

1. Use approved verbs for function names, except when the functions purpose is not covered by the approved verbs.
2. Use Verb-Noun naming convention for functions.
3. Ensure functions contain a ```[CmdletBinding()]``` decorator and a ```param()``` decorator, even if empty or not required.
4. Use canonical function comments. Write before the function declaration, not inside the function body. Describe the function's purpose, inputs, outputs, and other relevant information.
5. Prefer generating replies as valid Powershell. Provide commentary as valid comments ```<# Valid Comments #>```.
6. Ensure generated code is well formatted. Readability is paramount. Never sacrifice readability for cleverness.
7. We are working primarily with Linux systems. Avoid using aliases. Write cross platform everywhere possible.
8. All function bodies must have try-catch. Handle exceptions elegantly. Prefer ```Write-Host $_``` in error blocks.
10. Use command oriented terse comments ```(e.g., #)``` for inline comments and verbose comments ```(e.g., <# #>)``` for ```Get-Help``` comments.
12. Avoid using reserved keywords, ambiguous names as parameters, variables, or other declarations.
13. Prefer generating code that is idempotent. Avoid side effects unless explicitly stated and required.
15. Avoid hard coded values. Prefer mandatory parameters instead.
16. Ensure code adheres to security practices and guidelines compliant with CIS benchmarks.

*Here is an example of the high quality code you should generate*

```
# Opens a TCP stream capable of sending arbitrary data to a listening socket.
# This is bare minimum code required for a TCP stream writer.
# Can serve as base for RPC, HTTP, or other server.
function Send-PsNxCommand {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [string]$Hostname,
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [int]$Port,
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [string]$Command
    )

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Connects to a TCP server and sends a command.

    .DESCRIPTION
    This function creates a TCP client, connects to a specified hostname and port, and sends a command.
    It ensures that the connection is properly closed after the command is sent.

    .PARAMETER Hostname
    The hostname or IP address of the TCP server.

    .PARAMETER Port
    The port number of the TCP server.

    .PARAMETER Command
    The command to send to the TCP server.

    .EXAMPLE
    PS> Send-PsNxCommand -Hostname 'localhost' -Port 12080 -Command 'systemctl status'
